## On-Chain Risk & Activity Monitor

### 📌 Overview
The **On-Chain Risk & Activity Monitor** is an end-to-end data engineering and analytics project focused on **on-chain activity analysis, automated smart contract auditing, and real-time risk monitoring** for Ethereum-compatible blockchains.

The project simulates a real-world **DeFi / Web3 risk monitoring platform**, combining blockchain data ingestion, scalable analytics, automated audits, and alerting pipelines.

This repository showcases skills in:
- Blockchain data engineering
- On-chain analytics
- Smart contract risk assessment
- Automation and orchestration
- Modern data stack used by US-based Web3 and FinTech companies
